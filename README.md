⚔️ Berserk Quote Generator
Welcome to the Berserk Quote Generator—a tribute to one of the most legendary manga series ever created. This project randomly displays iconic quotes from various characters in Berserk, bringing the dark, philosophical, and powerful spirit of the story to life.
📖 About the Project
As a huge fan of Berserk, I wanted to build something simple yet meaningful. This generator uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation) to display random quotes from characters like Guts, Griffith, Skull Knight, and more.
Whether you're seeking inspiration, existential dread, or just want to relive the intensity of Kentaro Miura’s masterpiece—this tool delivers.
